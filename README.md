This is a detailed web app that uses a few APIs to fetch the weather info based on the user’s location. 
The location can be searched manually by typing the address using Google Geolocation API or automatically by the user’s current location through IP info. 
The data for the weather will be fetched using an API from a website called [Tomorrow.io](https://www.tomorrow.io/) in the form of a JSON file. 
Then, the data will be shown on a table, visualized on two charts.
